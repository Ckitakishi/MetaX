- We know, when using **iOS 11** on new devices ([Reference](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207022)), we can view, edit, or duplicate **HEIF** media. Normally, edited photos will be saved as original format, but if using *MetaX* on a older device, and editing **HEIF** photo downloaded from iCloud, new photo will be saved as **JPG** format. 

- If **Live Photos** has been edited, the new photo will be saved as normal photo.

#### Supported Media Types:

- [x] Image
- [ ] Video
